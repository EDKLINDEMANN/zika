# ZIKA Virus Agent-Based Model

## Overview

ZIKV, like other _flaviviruses_, is transmitted to humans primarily through the bites of infectious _Aedes_ mosquitoes in the subgenus _Stegomyia_, particularly _Ae. Aegypti_  [ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05013-9#ref-CR17 "Kramer, L. D. & Ebel, G. D. Dynamics of flavivirus infection in mosquitoes. Adv. Virus Res. 60, 187â€“232 (2003)."). We developed an agent-based model to include human and mosquito agents in the chain of disease transmission as well as sexual tranmission. The results from the agent-based model are used to address scientific and economic impact of ZIKV. 

This github repository stores all computer simulation code for ZIKV ABM model developed by Affan Shoukat, PhD Candidate @ York University. For replication of results, please `git checkout` the appropriate branch (see below).
